+ Removed INPUT_BOOSTER. Now when you get out the SPEN, the frequency does not lock to 1267 MHz. Now you can use CPU booster to set frequency on touch input with Kernel Aduitor. You will need to adjust the time in milli seconds that the input works at also.

+ Overclocked the GPU by 33 MHz, from 600 MHz to 633 MHz.

20161028
+ Added FIOPS I/O scheduler.
+ Added ZEN I/O scheduler.

20161027
+ Overclocked the CPU by 39 MHz, from 2649 MHz to 2688 MHz, no increase in voltage.
(A free boost of 39 MHz without having to pay for it!)
